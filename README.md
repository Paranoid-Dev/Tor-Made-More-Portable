Here, if you haven't installed Tor Browser already, do so now.

Make sure you have all the settings done as you prefer, because from now on, you can't change them without going through this process again.

Go to the folder where your Tor Browser is installed, select all the files and folders inside *Tor Browser/Browser* and compress it *without compression* (store options) (iexpress will compress it anyways, so this way is faster to unpack) and name it *Tor.zip*

Add *Tor.zip* in iexpress, and then add *Tor_Launcher.bat*

And then you're done!

(You can remove the normal Tor Browser install on your pc if you wish, the created Tor_Browser.exe will run independently.

# Usage
Tor_Browser.exe extracts itself into a temp folder, and runs from there.

Therefore, any changes you make to the browser, along with history and passwords etc, won't be saved.

Click the exe file to launch - it takes a little for the browser to launch - about 4 seconds for me, but it will vary on the specs of your PC

# To Do
Change exe icon so it matches Tor Browser

Change EXE description
